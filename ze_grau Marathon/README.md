# ze_grau_a03_4ff MARATHON MODE

Thanks to Kotya for the countplayer vscript.
Thanks to ZeddY^'s Servers for first playtest.

Stripper for ze_grau_a03_4ff.
Play all 3 stages (1-3) and try to complete them in 1 try!

Stripper is currently in a BETA Version. I will update and fix bugs when I have time.

Current bugs of note:
- Cannot play the map normally when this stripper is loaded. Only Marathon mode is available.

DO NOT combine these stripper changes with others such as fys rtv, rtv3, RNG rtv, etc. IT WILL BREAK THE MAP!
Use this stripper as it is, alone!

vscript goes in csgo\scripts\vscripts\kotya\grau
